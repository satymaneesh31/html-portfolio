<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm someone who loves celebrating the little moments in life, 
  and one of the biggest ones for me was my birthday on November 17, 2023. 
  It was a simple but special day that reminded me how important it is to cherish the things and people we care about.</p>

<p>Movies are a big part of my life. I’m always on the lookout for films that can make me feel something real and stay with me long after the credits roll. 
  Some of my favorites include Gifted, a beautiful story about family and choices, and Telugu dramas like Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (SVSC) and Lie. 
  They’ve left a lasting impression on me with their emotional depth and powerful storytelling.</p>

<p>I also enjoy thrillers a lot. One of my favorite edge-of-the-seat experiences was Rakshasudu, a film that kept me hooked with its suspense and clever plot.
   And when I’m in the mood for something light and fun, romantic comedies like Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar are my go-to. 
  I love movies that strike a good balance between humor, romance, and emotions.</p>
